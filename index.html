     <h1>Favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger One-Liners</h1>

      <table>

            <td>
              <h2>I'll Be Back</h2>
              <p>
              Perhaps Arnie's most famous one-liner from his long and distinguished career, this one-liner never gets old, even 30+ years after he first said it.
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

              <h2>Put That Cookie Down, NOW!</h2>
              <p>
              Even with over 15 years of experience in show business, our Austrian friend marries comedic chops perfectly to his bread-and-butter action hero-style delivery.
              </p>
          </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="images/Coming.gif" alt="Pumping Iron">
            </td>
            <td>
              <h2>I'm Coming Day and Night</h2>
               <p>
              Influencing an entire generation of aspiring bodybuilders, Arnie tells up exactly how it feels after he works out (and perhaps gives us a clue as to why he never stopped).
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="images/Ice.gif" alt="Batman & Robin">
            </td>
            <td>
              <h2>Let's Kick Some Ice</h2>
               <p>
              The flip side of cheesy one-liners is that it can sometimes backfire spectacularly. In this horribly forgetful version of the caped crusader, Arnold only speaks in terrible ice-related puns. Around this time he started to become a parody of himself.
